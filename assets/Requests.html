          <h1> Introduction to Requests</h1>
          <p>
            The Requests is a python library which is named after a Lewis Carroll poem of the same name in “Alice’s Adventures in the Wonderland”. Requests is a python package and as the name suggests, parses the unwanted data and helps to organize and format the messy web data by fixing bad HTML and present to us in an easily-traversible XML structures.
    
    In short, Requests is a python package which allows us to pull data out of HTML and XML documents.
    
    Requests - Installation
    As BeautifulSoup is not a standard python library, we need to install it first. We are going to install the BeautifulSoup 4 library (also known as BS4), which is the latest one.
    
    To isolate our working environment so as not to disturb the existing setup, let us first create a virtual environment.
    
    Creating a virtual environment (optional)
    A virtual environment allows us to create an isolated working copy of python for a specific project without affecting the outside setup.

          <h2>Why Should You Learn Dart?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Free and open source</li>
            <li>To be comfortable in a flutter</li>
            <li>To develop multi-platform apps for android, iOS, windows, mac, Linux, etc.</li>
            <li>Fastest growing programming language.</li>
            <li>It has rich set of libraries and tools.</li>
            <li>Huge community support</li>
          </ul>
         <h2>How Much Time Does It Take to Learn Dart?</h2>
         <p>Generally, learning programming takes 2-3 months. You can catch up in a few weeks if you know another programming language like java, c#, javascript, etc.</p>
         <h2>Question For Practice</h2>
         <p>At the end of the session, we provide you with challenges for Dart, and they will help you to improve what you're learning. Completing these questions will help you to master Dart.</p>
         <h2>Accelerate your Workflow</h2>
         <p>Save any snippet in this tutorial to your personal micro-repository with Pieces for Developers to speed up your workflow. Pieces is a centralized productivity suite that leverages AI to help developers save snippets, extract code from screenshots, auto-enrich code, and much more.</p>

      <h2>Huge Community</h2>
      <p>Python community is huge which helps you wherever you stuck while writing code.
        Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means the data assigned to a variable tells, what type of variable it is. It saves lot of time and makes work faster.

    <h1>Python 'requests' Module for Beginners</h1>

<p>The 'requests' module in Python allows you to send HTTP requests to web services and retrieve data from websites.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>You can install the 'requests' module using pip:</p>

<pre>
pip install requests
</pre>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>To send a GET request and retrieve content from a website:</p>

<pre>
import requests

response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')
print(response.text)
</pre>

<p>Here, we import the 'requests' module, send a GET request to 'https://www.example.com', and print the response content.</p>

<h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
<p>The 'requests' module supports various HTTP methods:</p>

<ul>
    <li>GET: Retrieve data from a server.</li>
    <li>POST: Send data to a server.</li>
    <li>PUT: Update data on a server.</li>
    <li>DELETE: Remove data from a server.</li>
    <!-- Add more methods as needed -->
</ul>

<h2>Handling Response</h2>
<p>You can access response data using the 'response' object:</p>

<pre>
import requests

response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')

# Status code
print(response.status_code)

# Response content
print(response.text)

# Headers
print(response.headers)
</pre>

<p>The 'status_code' attribute contains the HTTP status code, 'text' contains the response content, and 'headers' contains the HTTP headers.</p>

<h2>Headers and Parameters</h2>
<p>You can set custom headers and parameters in your requests:</p>

<pre>
import requests

headers = {'User-Agent': 'My User Agent'}
params = {'key': 'value'}

response = requests.get('https://www.example.com', headers=headers, params=params)
</pre>

<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>You should handle exceptions when making requests:</p>

<pre>
import requests

try:
    response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
    print(f"HTTP error: {err}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
    print(f"Request error: {err}")
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The 'requests' module is a powerful tool for working with HTTP requests in Python. It allows you to interact with web services, retrieve data, and handle various aspects of HTTP communication.</p>
