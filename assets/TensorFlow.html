          <h1> Introduction to Tensorflow</h1>
          <p>
            The Tensorflow is a python library which is named after a Lewis Carroll poem of the same name in “Alice’s Adventures in the Wonderland”. Tensorflow is a python package and as the name suggests, parses the unwanted data and helps to organize and format the messy web data by fixing bad HTML and present to us in an easily-traversible XML structures.
    
    In short, Tensorflow is a python package which allows us to pull data out of HTML and XML documents.
    
    Tensorflow - Installation
    As BeautifulSoup is not a standard python library, we need to install it first. We are going to install the BeautifulSoup 4 library (also known as BS4), which is the latest one.
    
    To isolate our working environment so as not to disturb the existing setup, let us first create a virtual environment.
    
    Creating a virtual environment (optional)
    A virtual environment allows us to create an isolated working copy of python for a specific project without affecting the outside setup.
          </p>
    
          <h2>Why Should You Learn Dart?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Free and open source</li>
            <li>To be comfortable in a flutter</li>
            <li>To develop multi-platform apps for android, iOS, windows, mac, Linux, etc.</li>
            <li>Fastest growing programming language.</li>
            <li>It has rich set of libraries and tools.</li>
            <li>Huge community support</li>
          </ul>
         <h2>How Much Time Does It Take to Learn Dart?</h2>
         <p>Generally, learning programming takes 2-3 months. You can catch up in a few weeks if you know another programming language like java, c#, javascript, etc.</p>
         <h2>Question For Practice</h2>
         <p>At the end of the session, we provide you with challenges for Dart, and they will help you to improve what you're learning. Completing these questions will help you to master Dart.</p>
         <h2>Accelerate your Workflow</h2>
         <p>Save any snippet in this tutorial to your personal micro-repository with Pieces for Developers to speed up your workflow. Pieces is a centralized productivity suite that leverages AI to help developers save snippets, extract code from screenshots, auto-enrich code, and much more.</p>

      <h2>Huge Community</h2>
      <p>Python community is huge which helps you wherever you stuck while writing code.
        Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means the data assigned to a variable tells, what type of variable it is. It saves lot of time and makes work faster.
